# advancedpythonprogramming
This repository contains a number of interactive Python Notebooks for lectures in advanced programming.
Agenda of the lecture:
- Python Crash Course
    - Procedural Programming
    - Strings and Basic Classes
    - Object-Oriented Review
    - Functional Programming
- Exceptions
- Test Driven Development
- Generalized Iteration
- Packages
- External Libraries (matplotlib, fpdf)
- Graphical User Interfaces
- Streams and File Access
- Parallel Programming

Additionally it contains some images for illustration and some normal python script files, in case the ipynb-functionalities weren't sufficient (i.e. when talking about test-driven-development and multiprocessing).
Feel free to use/copy them.
